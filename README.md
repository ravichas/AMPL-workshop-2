In this workshop, we will demonstrate how to use Atom Modeling PipeLine (AMPL; https://github.com/ATOMconsortium/AMPL), a new, open-source conda-based software that automates key drug discovery steps. AMPL is designed to take molecular binding data (ex., IC50, ki, etc.) and carry out the Machine-Learning (ML) steps with minimal intervention. In this workshop, we will cover the topics listed in the figure shown above. Future workshops will cover the next steps (modeling, inference) in drug discovery.
The workshop on June 8 will include two parts, a short presentation followed by a hands-on tutorial. 

To begin: 
  
* Click, the following "Open in COLAB" badge,[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ravichas/AMPL-workshop-1/blob/main/EDA_With_Harmonization_Using_AMPL.ipynb), to open the Google COLAB notebook

* If you have trouble with the previous step, click **EDA_With_Harmonization_Using_AMPL.ipynb** link shown above to open a browser tab and then click on the "Open in COLAB" batge to view the live notebook. To save the notebook in your Google Drive -make sure you are logged in with your Google account-, you need click on "Copy to Drive".
